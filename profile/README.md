👋🏽 BuildingVolumes is a global initiative by creatives, software engineers, teachers, and artists with the aim to create a free and open-source volumetric capture and playback pipeline.

We want to create **free, open source, and sustainable tools** for small artists, creatives, filmographers, game artists and everyone interested in the creation of Volumetric Video.
